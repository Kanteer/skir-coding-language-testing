Skir is a programming language I'm making in order to make it more accessable and easy to code for beginners. It's made from the ground up and is made for those with little to no scripting abilities.

Skir is not only a game creating engine for Godot, it's also able to be used for Luau (Roblox) and basic computing for computers.
