Skir is a programming language I'm making in order to make it more accessable and easy to code for beginners. It's made from the ground up and is made for those with little to no scripting abilities.

Skir is not only a game creating engine for Godot, it's also able to be used for Luau (Roblox) and basic computing for computers.

The language is created to be similar to the English language, while also being easy to read and use. I will make a visual script for it sooner or later, since it would be pretty easy seeing as the code is relatively simple.
